```

Let's make an example from the documentation. We set up a control structure to create a large tree by allowing leaves to contain only a few instances.

```{r}
ctrl <- rpart.control(minbucket = 3)
```

Then we fit a tree using the control object and the test data from the `rpart`package.

```{r}
fit <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis, control = ctrl)

```

Let's look at the tree.

```{r}
rpart.plot::rpart.plot(fit, type = 5, extra = 101)
```

And now some more details about the fitted tree.

```{r}
print(fit)

xh_frame <- kable(fit$frame)
kable_styling(xh_frame, "striped")

xh_yval2 <- kable(fit$frame$yval2)
kable_styling(xh_yval2, "striped")
```
